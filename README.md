# MNIST-Classifier-App
Android app to classify hand drawn numbers using Tensorflow machine learning model. 

## Creating the model
Before creating the App, we must first create a model in tensorflow. The model is created with Python and is then
frozen and imported inside Android Studio. The app supports two different classification models; a single layer SoftMax model
and a Convolutional Neural Network. The SoftMax model has an final accurary of ~92% while the Convolutional Neural Network increases
the accuracy to ~98%.

### SoftMax 
The SoftMax model code can be found at[mnist_model.py](../model/mnist_model.py).
